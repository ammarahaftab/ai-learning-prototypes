# AI Learning Prototypes

This repository contains selected prototypes and experiments exploring how software, data, and generative AI can be used to design effective, scalable learning experiences.

The focus of this work includes:
- Translating complex technical concepts into usable learning workflows
- Experimenting with AI- and LLM-supported learning features
- Using data and analytics to evaluate learner engagement
- Rapid prototyping prior to production implementation

## Projects

### 1. AI-Supported Learning Feedback Prototype
**Goal:** Explore how large language models can provide structured, formative feedback to learners in a scalable and responsible way.

**What this prototype demonstrates:**
- Python-based experimentation with prompt design
- Structured feedback generation
- Early evaluation of output quality and limitations

**Skills demonstrated:** Python, LLM workflows, experimentation, learning design
